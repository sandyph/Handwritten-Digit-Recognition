Handwritten Digit Recognition using Different Convolutional Neural Network Models in Machine Learning

The project implemented different CNN network models (ResNet-18, MLP, and LeNet) 
to solve the handwritten digit recognition problem using the MNIST dataset. 
Any CNN model gives over 97 percent accuracy for the MNIST dataset, according to the results. 
With only one input layer and two fully connected layers, MLP takes less time to train the algorithm. 
With more convolutional layers, training time increases. 
With a 3x3 filter size, training time increases significantly as in ResNet-18.
